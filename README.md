## Chatapp-python
Work in progress: Multithreaded CLI chat application.

The goal is to create a CLI chat application similar to an MMORPG chat system. Mainly inspired by the legendary MMORPG Dark Age of Camelot.

#### Main functionalities:
- Users will be able to send texts or files between each other directly or create chat channels where they can invite other users.
- The chat history will not be saved in the server. The users will have an option to save their chat history in their own device while exiting the program.

#### Commands:
```
/send <user-name>
/who <user-name> or <channel-name>
/create <channel-name>
/join <channel-name>
/kick <user-name>
/ban <user-name>
/leave <channel-name>
/quit
```

Any contributions or suggestions are welcome.
